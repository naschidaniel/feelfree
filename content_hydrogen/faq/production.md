## Why is it cheaper to produce hydrogen in Spain than Germany?

The cost of green hydrogen depends to an important extent on the cost of the renewable electricity used. The cost for Solar energy depends on the intensity of the sun. With the same size of PV installation it is possible to produce twice as many MWhs in Spain than in the north of Germany, because the sun shines longer and is more intense in Spain. The solar energy to be harvested in different parts of Europe is indicated in the graph by the color.
