# Reserve Parachute Service

The intervals for packing reserve parachutes are specified by the manufacturers in the operating manuals of the respective parachute types. These deadlines should be adhered to in order to guarantee reliable and swift opening of the device in case of an emergency. The typical packing interval is once per year.

If a rescue device becomes wet or damp or has been exposed to high heat, it must be ventilated and repacked immediately!

After every emergency deployment, especially after overload, such as in a tree landing, the rescue device must undergo a thorough inspection. If a service booklet or packing certificate is available, please provide it so that we can make an entry for repacking.

## Service

- Deployment test
- Visual inspection of all connecting parts
- Inspection for mechanical damage
- The rescue device is hung loosely in room climate for at least one day before packing to allow proper ventilation and discharge of static electricity.
