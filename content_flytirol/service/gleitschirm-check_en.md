# Paraglider Check

During the 2-year check, a thorough inspection of the paraglider is conducted to ensure the safety of your paragliding experience.

The processes include comprehensive documentation of the paraglider's data, followed by measuring the air permeability and checking the tensile strength of the fabric. A thorough visual inspection for cracks and holes is carried out on a special apparatus. Defective lines are manually identified and replaced if necessary. The tensile strength of the lines is checked using duplicates and a line-breaking system, followed by laser measurements of line lengths. Trim adjustments are made, whenever possible, based on new values by adjusting the attachment points. After final corrections, the paraglider receives a check stamp for safe flying.
