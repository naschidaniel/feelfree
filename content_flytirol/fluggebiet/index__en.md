# Flightpark Westendorf 

## Training Area 

Welcome to the Westendorf flight area, a perfect place for both beginners and experienced pilots. The area offers three take-off points facing West-Northwest, East, and North. Even with winds from Southwest or Southeast, take-offs are easy. The geographical location of the flight area in a wide valley allows beginners to fly all day and gain valuable experience in thermals and convergences. For practice flights, there are also 300m and 400m take-off points available nearby.

## Take-off Points

The take-off points are positioned near the Choralpe and face W / N / E / SE, always marked by windsocks, etc.

## Landing Area

A large and obstacle-free landing area awaits you directly across from the valley station, behind the parking lot. It is easily recognizable by the large windsock positioned at the edge of the parking lot, the beach flags, and various wind vanes.

## Soaring

With suitable wind conditions, the flight area allows soaring in the directions W / N / E. With favorable east positions, the terrain is particularly suitable for top landing training due to the topographical conditions.

## Thermal Flying

The special location of the Choralpe in Westendorf provides excellent conditions for thermal flying in spring. As early summer approaches, the conditions become calmer, allowing less experienced pilots, especially in the morning and early afternoon, to enjoy their flights. Thermals here tend to weaken and usually pick up again in the late afternoon. In the summer months, the Choralpe also stands out for the opportunity of convergence flying. As the year progresses, the thermals become calmer, making the air the calmest in the fall. On July 9, 2023, experienced cross-country pilot and local Christopher Manzl set the house record by flying a 231 km FAI triangle! The optimal location in the beautiful Kitzb√ºhel Alps has additional advantages for experienced cross-country pilots: the connection to the Wilder Kaiser is in the immediate vicinity. It is also possible to connect directly to the beautiful Pinzgau for wonderful hours in the air.

## Meteorological Features:

The Choralpe in Westendorf offers everything a pilot's heart desires. Due to thermals, it caters to those who want to enjoy their flight for as long as possible. Nevertheless, the Choralpe is a relatively wind-protected area, and the valley wind reaches us in Westendorf in a weakened form due to the bowl shape of the valley. This results in fewer lee traps.

Due to its location, Westendorf has a good all-around view, allowing early detection of weather changes. In winter, the Choralpe offers an above-average number of good flying days, where you can enjoy the romantic snowy Alpine panorama.
