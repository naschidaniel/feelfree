# A-License Complete Course

## From Pedestrian to Pilot

Our complete package offers everything you need to become an **independent pilot!** You benefit from all the mentioned advantages, which also apply when booking individual courses – starting from the basic course through the high-altitude seminars, the theory course, and the rental equipment. By booking the A-License Complete Course, you don't have to book each course separately, and you **even save money!**

The **A-License Complete Course** consists of the **basic course**, the **theory course**, and the **high-altitude flights**, forming the complete package to go from pedestrian to pilot.

The **basic course** should be completed **within one week** and is valid for three years to complete the license. You can **flexibly schedule the high-altitude flights** in consultation with us to adapt them optimally to your needs.

Your goal is to complete **40 high-altitude flights**, which then qualify you for the **practical exam**. The **theoretical exam** can be taken before that.

Upon request, you can add **rental equipment** for participation in the A-License Complete Course. This equipment is available to you **until the 30th high-altitude flight**, allowing you to test various parachutes and harnesses and find the one that suits you. The **last 10 high-altitude flights** should be completed with your **own equipment** to be optimally prepared for your exam and subsequent independent flying.

Here, too, we have an **unbeatable offer** for you: If you decide to purchase brand-new equipment (parachute and harness) at our flight school, **we waive the €410 rental fee from the purchase price**. If you prefer a previously flown parachute and harness, we still offer a **discount of €200** on your first piece of equipment!

**IMPORTANT!** This offer is valid until your 30th high-altitude flight. If you still want to fly with rental equipment, it is possible for €10 per high-altitude flight.

What are you waiting for?

We look forward to having you!
