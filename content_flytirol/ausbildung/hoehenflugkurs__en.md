# High-Altitude Flight Course

## Fly, Fly, Fly

After **successfully completing the basic course**, it's time for the high-altitude flight course. Here, we aim to provide you with confidence in **takeoff, landing, and turning techniques** by accumulating supervised flight experience in our beautiful and **versatile training area in the Kitzb√ºhel Alps**.

For independent flying, it's crucial to gain experience in **different wind conditions** and at **different takeoff and landing sites**. Descent techniques such as **using ears (Big Ears)** are also perfected in this seminar. We tailor our approach to your needs, guiding you **via radio, just like in the basic course.**

During this seminar, you'll aim to complete as many flights as possible to approach the 40 high-altitude flights required for the paraglider license / A-license examination.
