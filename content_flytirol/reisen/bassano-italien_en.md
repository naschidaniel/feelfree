# Bassano – Italy

In the Southern Alps of Italy lies the paragliding paradise of Bassano del Grappa. This paragliding haven boasts a mild climate in winter and spring, with an astonishing 300+ flyable days per year!
Monte Grappa beckons with a total of 5 take-off points, ranging from approximately 700m to 1200m in altitude. In the mornings, Monte Grappa invites pilots to serene morning flights, while evenings offer tranquil flights against the backdrop of the sunset. In the afternoons, the moist-warm sea air in Bassano provides ideal conditions for hours of thermal and cross-country flying. The flight conditions along the Monte Grappa range also allow for kilometers of soaring along the ridge edges.
Two large landing sites await pilots in the valley, with a shuttle service available back to the take-off points. After flying, we conclude the day with a shared dinner and a relaxed get-together, savoring the Italian Dolce Vita.
