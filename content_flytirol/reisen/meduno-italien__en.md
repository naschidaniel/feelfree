# Meduno - Italy

In Northern Italy, nestled on the southern side of the Italian Alps, lies the picturesque village of Meduno. The Monte Valinis boasts a spacious take-off area with expansive alpine meadows and a grass-covered summit ridge. In the morning, it invites wind play, ground handling, and top landings. As thermals set in, we commence our flights.

Meduno is a suitable destination for pilots of all skill levels and leaves nothing to be desired. Due to its special location, the weather conditions are usually very stable, inviting hours of thermal and cross-country flying. When thermals create more challenging conditions in the midday hours, less experienced pilots can enjoy a short break in the flying bar. Experienced pilots can use these conditions to practice strong wind techniques (reverse launch, cobra launch, etc.). In the afternoon, perfect soaring conditions usually set in, allowing soaring and flying until the picturesque sunset.

After flying, we conclude the day with a shared dinner and a relaxed get-together, savoring the Italian Dolce Vita.
