# Dune Flying at Dune du Pilat

Dune du Pilat is located on the Atlantic coast near Arcachon in France. With a height of 110 meters, a width of 500 meters, and a length of approximately 2.7 kilometers, it is the largest sand dune in Europe. Thanks to its laminar sea breeze, it invites you to hours of ground handling, low-altitude flying, and soaring!

In close proximity to Dune du Pilat, there is a campsite where Fly Tirol Flight School can set up our tents. If you prefer staying in a bungalow, that's certainly not a problem either. Due to the proximity to the dune, you can spend the whole day barefoot in the "sandbox of Europe" playing with your paraglider.

When you climb the dune, you'll be rewarded with an impressive view of the Atlantic and the inland area, including the Arcachon Basin with its extensive maritime pine forests in the Landes de Gascogne region.

## Requirements:

- A-License (suitable for participants with limited flying experience)
- Personal flying equipment
- Valid 2-year check of the paraglider
- Appropriate liability insurance
- The reserve parachute should have been packed within the last twelve months

### What's included:

- Introduction to the flying area
- Guidance by our instructors
- Soaring and ground handling training
- Daily weather briefing
