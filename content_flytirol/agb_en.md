# General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of Feel Free GmbH

As of: May 30, 2023

## 1. Participation Conditions and Requirements

The participant (student, passenger) confirms that they meet the health requirements for participating in the event, especially in the flight and outdoor activities.

The participant confirms their good physical and mental condition. They are obliged to appear at the agreed meeting point at the specified time (for all activities). The participant is obligated to follow the instructions of the flight instructor/tandem pilot during takeoff, landing, and flight. Failure of the customer to appear at the agreed-upon time without cancellation results in the irrevocable loss of the claim to services, but not of any outstanding payment for the service.

Each participant is obligated to inform the course leader, flight instructor, or tandem pilot if, within the last 12 months, they have had a serious accident (broken bones, ligament tear, concussion, or similar), been in medical treatment for a serious illness (heart, spine, intervertebral discs, high blood pressure, diabetes, organ diseases, or similar) or suffered from mental or psychological defects (drug addiction, consciousness disorders, or similar), or consumed alcohol, medication, or drugs within the last 12 hours, or if they are pregnant.

The flight school assumes no liability for adverse consequences arising from the participant's failure to meet personal requirements. If a customer does not meet the special suitability, physically or otherwise, the flight school or the responsible flight instructor has the right to exclude the customer from the event. If the customer makes false statements in their registration regarding their age, data, address, physical or other suitability, the flight school or the responsible flight instructor has the right to exclude the customer from the event without any compensation claim from the customer.

## 2. Registration, Withdrawal from the Contract, Prices, Payment Conditions

The customer agrees to the conditions of the flight school by submitting an online booking, through verbal appointment fixing on-site or by phone, through written booking via email, and/or by agreeing to the redemption of a voucher, and concludes a legally binding contract for the agreed service. The course or tandem fee is due in advance.

Mountain rides are not included in the flight prices. By oral commitment or booking through the website, the customer also commits to pay the flight price. Paragliding tandem flights are payable without deduction.

A withdrawal by the participant from the contract is free of charge up to two weeks before the event, and for withdrawals after this deadline, 100% cancellation fees apply. Basic and high-altitude flight courses must be completed by the participant within one year; otherwise, they are considered consumed. If the participant jeopardizes their safety or that of others or disrupts the lesson in a grossly negligent/intentional manner, the flight school reserves the right to terminate the contract without notice. The course fee will not be refunded in this case.

The scope of services and prices can be found in the respective valid event descriptions and refer to one person. All course and tandem fees are due in advance.

## 3. Voucher

The voucher has a non-extendable, final validity of 12 months from the date of issue. Special arrangements are possible by agreement in individual cases. The vouchers must be handed in at the flight school on the day of the flight. Anytime, the flight school can transfer services to other beneficiaries under the same conditions.

## 4. Warranty and Expiry of Services

If the implementation/termination of a course is not possible due to weather conditions or if a participant drops out due to an injury or illness, there are no claims for a refund of the course fee. Missed course contents can be made up within 12 months. However, this does not apply to courses that include travel. If the course participant is absent without excuse during the course, there is no entitlement to replacement.

## 5. Liability, Insurance

The flight school and its agents are only liable for accident and consequential damages to the extent that liability insurance - without taking recourse against the aforementioned parties - covers the damage. Any liability beyond this for possible damages is excluded.

The flight school is not responsible for damage caused by the course participants to the school's own flight equipment. These must be reimbursed by the course participant to the flight school within 14 days.

Course participants are insured by the flight school against any claims by third parties, and tandem passengers are also covered by liability and accident insurance. Other insurances do not exist. The flight school is not liable for accidents, loss, theft, or damage to the property of the customer during training.

## 6. Pictures, Video

When taking pictures or videos, the organizer has the participant's consent to use individual pictures or video sequences commercially for films, the homepage, etc. If the participant expressly does not wish this, they must notify the flight instructor in writing before the start of the course.

## 7. Further Provisions

All course dates are subject to change. Courses may be canceled or postponed due to weather conditions. All listed courses can be postponed or canceled due to a too small group size. Please ensure proper travel cancellation insurance (hotel, flight, etc.) for trips, SIVs, and all other bookings.

Both locally in Tyrol and abroad for our trips, SIVs, and courses, we have partner hotels where our students can book accommodation. Hotel bookings must be made by the participants themselves and are not associated with Fly Tirol.

Participants should plan their arrival so that a timely start of the course is guaranteed. If this is not possible for organizational reasons, please contact Fly Tirol, and we will find a solution.

Flight tickets, arrival, and departure must be organized independently by the participant.

## 8. Ineffectiveness

The ineffectiveness of individual provisions of these GTC or the training and course contract does not result in the ineffectiveness of the entire contract.

## 9. Jurisdiction

Austrian law applies. The place of performance is the registered office of the flight school; for all disputes arising from our contracts, the Kitzb√ºhel District Court is agreed upon as the competent court.
