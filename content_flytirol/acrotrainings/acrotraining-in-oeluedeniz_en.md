# Acro Training Ölüdeniz - Turkey

Add excitement to your flights with this spectacular form of flying! This training is suitable for both beginners in the acrobatic field and seasoned acro pilots looking to learn new tricks or perfect already mastered ones. Your instructor is none other than the former Team World Champion and Vice World Champion in Acrobatic Paragliding, Sebastian Kahn.

The training covers typical acro basics based on skill level, such as Flyback, Dynamic Full-Stall, SAT, Misty Flip, etc. It also includes connections between maneuvers like Misty to Heli, SAT to Heli, and for more advanced participants, a repertoire of current tricks, both untwisted and twisted. Popular ones include Twisted Infinity and Twisted Joker (reverse).

You'll spend your acro training with like-minded pilots near the coastal town of Fethiye in the Turkish region of Ölüdeniz, known for its clear sea water in vibrant blue and green shades. To admire this perspective from the air, we launch our flights from Mount Babadağ. After a breathtaking flight over the Lycian coast, we land at the beach promenade of the bay, inviting you to take a dip. On the day after arrival, the acro training begins with a briefing, maneuver discussion using a flight simulator, and reference materials. This session addresses individual preferences, skills, and concerns. The specific learning goals of each participant are considered during this discussion. To assist participants in training exercises, our instructor provides guidance via radio communication. This allows for the repetition and correction of maneuvers during flights. The flights are recorded, and the video material is analyzed and discussed with participants in the evening. Additionally, a rescue boat is available at all times for participants. After flights, theory, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner at the beautiful Ölüdeniz beach promenade.
