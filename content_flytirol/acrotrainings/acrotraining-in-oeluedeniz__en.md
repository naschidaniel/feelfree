# Acro Training Ölüdeniz - Turkey

Give your flight more excitement with this **spectacular style of flying**! This training is suitable for both **beginners in the acrobatic field** and **experienced acro-pilots** looking to learn new tricks or perfect already learned ones. Your instructor is none other than the former **team world champion and vice-world champion** in acrobatic paragliding, **Sebastian Kahn**.

The training covers, depending on skill level, typical **acro-basics** such as **Flyback, Dynamic Full-Stall, SAT, Misty Flip**, etc., as well as the connections between individual maneuvers, such as **Misty to Heli, SAT to Heli**... For those already **advanced or professionals** among you, we also offer a vast repertoire of current tricks, both untwisted and twisted. Highly sought after here are **Twisted Infinity and Twisted Joker (reverse)**.

You'll spend your acro training with like-minded individuals near the coastal town of Fethiye in the Turkish region of **Ölüdeniz**, known for its clear turquoise lagoon waters.

To enjoy this aerial view, we launch our flights from **Mount Babadağ**. After a **breathtaking flight over the Lycian coast**, we land on the fine sandy beach of the bay, inviting for a swim.

On the day after arrival, your acro training starts with a **briefing**, **maneuver discussions using the flight simulator**, and teaching materials. This includes addressing the individual wishes, skills, and concerns of each participant. The **individual learning goals** of each course participant are also considered during this discussion.

To best support our participants in the acro training exercises, the pilots are guided over the radio by our **flight instructor**. This allows for the repetition and correction of maneuvers during a flight. The flights are also recorded with a camera. The **video material** is analyzed and discussed with the participants in the evening. Additionally, a **rescue boat** is always ready for our course participants.

After the flights, theory, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a **communal dinner** along the beautiful promenade of **Ölüdeniz**.
