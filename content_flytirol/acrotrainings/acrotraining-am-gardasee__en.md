# Acro Training at Lake Garda

Add excitement to your flights with this spectacular form of flying! This training is suitable for both beginners in the acrobatic field and seasoned acro pilots looking to learn new tricks or perfect already mastered ones. Your instructor is none other than the former Team World Champion and Vice World Champion in Acrobatic Paragliding, Sebastian Kahn.

The training covers typical acro basics based on skill level, such as Flyback, Dynamic Full-Stall, SAT, Misty Flip, etc. It also includes connections between maneuvers like Misty to Heli, SAT to Heli, and for more advanced participants, a repertoire of current tricks, both untwisted and twisted. Popular ones include Twisted Infinity and Twisted Joker (reverse).

You'll spend your acro training with like-minded pilots amidst the Italian charm of Lake Garda. On the arrival day, the training begins with a briefing, maneuver discussion using a flight simulator, and reference materials. This session addresses individual preferences, skills, and concerns. The specific learning goals of each participant are considered during this discussion. To assist participants in acro exercises, our instructor provides guidance via radio communication. This allows for the repetition and correction of maneuvers during flights. The flights are recorded, and the video material is analyzed and discussed with participants in the evening. Additionally, a rescue boat is available in Lake Garda for the participants. After flights, theory, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner to unwind.
