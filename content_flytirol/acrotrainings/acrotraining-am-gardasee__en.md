# Acro Training at Lake Garda

Give your flight more excitement with this **spectacular style of flying**! This training is suitable for both **beginners in the acrobatic field** and **experienced acro-pilots** looking to learn new tricks or perfect already learned ones. Your instructor is none other than the former **team world champion and vice-world champion** in acrobatic paragliding, **Sebastian Kahn**.

The training covers, depending on skill level, typical **acro-basics** such as **Flyback, Dynamic Full-Stall, SAT, Misty Flip**, etc., as well as the connections between individual maneuvers, such as **Misty to Heli, SAT to Heli**... For those already **advanced or professionals** among you, we also offer a vast repertoire of current tricks, both untwisted and twisted. Highly sought after here are **Twisted Infinity and Twisted Joker (reverse)**.

You'll spend your acro training with like-minded individuals in the **Italian charm of Lake Garda**. On the **day of arrival**, the acro training begins with a **site briefing**, **maneuver discussions using the flight simulator**, and with the help of **teaching materials**.

Here, individual wishes, skills, and concerns of each participant are addressed. The **individual learning goals** of each course participant are also considered during this discussion. To best support our participants in the **acro training exercises**, the pilots are guided **via radio by our flight instructor**. This allows for the repetition and correction of maneuvers during a flight.

The **flights** are also **recorded with a camera**. The **video material** is analyzed and discussed with the participants in the evening. Additionally, a rescue boat is ready in **Lake Garda** for our course participants.

After the flights, theory, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner to leisurely conclude the day.
