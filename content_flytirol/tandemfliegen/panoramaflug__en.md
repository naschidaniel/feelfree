# Panoramaflight

Soar freely through the air like a bird and enjoy the breathtaking view! Join us for a fascinating flying experience from the best flying mountain in the Kitzbühel Alps. The duration is about 15 to 20 minutes, during which we overcome an altitude difference of 1000 meters. 

We look forward to seeing you!

## Info

Panoramaflights are possible all year round and therefore differ from our thermal flights, which can only be offered in the spring and summer months. Book online or simply contact our tandem hotline to secure your appointment now!
