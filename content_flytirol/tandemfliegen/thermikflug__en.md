# Thermal Paragliding

If you want to extend your tandem flying adventure, our Thermal Tandem Paragliding is the perfect choice for you!

Similar to birds, we use thermal updrafts to extend the flight experience to approximately 30. As thermals typically become strong enough only around midday, we schedule flights between 12:30 and 17:00. Since thermal flights depend on seasonal and weather conditions, please consult our Tandem Hotline before making a reservation.

## Information

Thermal flights are usually only possible during the spring and summer months when thermal development is strong enough to lift us upward. If you desire a thermal flight in late summer or autumn, please contact our Tandem Hotline for further assistance.
