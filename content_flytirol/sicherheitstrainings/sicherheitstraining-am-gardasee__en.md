# Safety Training at Lake Garda

Already a paraglider pilot with an A-license and looking to be optimally prepared for exceptional flight situations? Join Fly Tyrol flight school at the beautiful Lago Di Garda for professional guidance from Sebastian Kahn in simulating extreme situations and perfecting various descent techniques such as the spiral dive and B-stall to master or avoid critical flight situations in the future.

Together with fellow pilots, you'll experience your safety training amidst the Italian charm of Lake Garda.

On the day of arrival, the safety training begins with an area briefing, maneuver discussions using the flight simulator, and reference materials. Individual participant preferences, skills, and concerns are addressed during this session. The specific learning goals of each participant are also taken into account.

To best support participants in the safety training exercises, pilots are guided by our instructor via radio. This allows maneuvers to be repeated and corrected during flights. The flights are also recorded with a camera, and the video material is analyzed and discussed with participants in the evening. Additionally, a rescue boat is available in Lake Garda for course participants.

After flights, theory sessions, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner and socializing to unwind.
