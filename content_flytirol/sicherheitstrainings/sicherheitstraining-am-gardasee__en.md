# Safety Training at Lake Garda

You are already a paragliding pilot and **hold the A-License**, and you want to be **optimally prepared for exceptional flight situations**? Then join the **Fly Tirol Flight School** at the beautiful Lago Di Garda to simulate extreme situations under the **professional guidance of Sebastian Kahn** and learn or perfect various descent techniques such as the **Spiral Dive and B-Stall**. This will enable you to **master or avoid critical flight situations** in the future.

You'll spend your safety training with like-minded individuals in the **Italian charm of Lake Garda**.

On the day after arrival, the safety training **begins with a site briefing**, **maneuver discussions using the flight simulator**, and with the help of **teaching materials**. Here, individual wishes, skills, and concerns of each participant are addressed. The **individual learning goals** of each course participant are also considered during this discussion.

To best support our participants in the exercises of the safety training, the **pilots are guided via radio by our flight instructor**. This allows for the repetition and correction of maneuvers during a flight.

The **flights** are also **recorded with a camera**. The **video material** is analyzed and discussed with the participants in the evening. Additionally, a **rescue boat is always ready** for our course participants.

After the flights, theory, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner and to sit together to leisurely conclude the day.
