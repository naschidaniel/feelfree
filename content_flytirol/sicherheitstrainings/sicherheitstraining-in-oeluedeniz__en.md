# Safety Training Ölüdeniz - Turkey

You are already a paragliding pilot and **hold the A-License**. You want to **optimally prepare for exceptional flight situations** and combine your safety training with a vacation? Then fly with the **Fly Tirol Flight School** to the beautiful Lycian coast of Turkey, where, under the **professional guidance of Sebastian Kahn**, you'll simulate extreme situations and **learn or perfect various descent techniques** such as the **Spiral Dive** and the **B-Stall** to **master or avoid critical flight situations** in the future.

You'll spend your **safety training with like-minded individuals** near the coastal town of Fethiye in the **Turkish region of Ölüdeniz**, known for its clear lagoon waters in vibrant shades of blue and green.

To enjoy this aerial view, we launch our flights from **Mount Babadağ**. After a breathtaking flight over the Lycian coast, we land on the fine sandy beach of the bay, inviting for a swim.

On the day after arrival, the safety training **begins with a site briefing**, **maneuver discussions using the flight simulator**, and with the help of **teaching materials**. Here, individual wishes, skills, and concerns of each participant are addressed. The **individual learning goals** of each course participant are also considered during this discussion.

To best support our participants in the exercises of the safety training, the **pilots are guided via radio by our flight instructor**. This allows for the repetition and correction of maneuvers during a flight. The **flights** are also **recorded with a camera**. The **video material** is analyzed and discussed with the participants in the evening. Additionally, a **rescue boat is always ready** for our course participants.

After the flights, theory, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner along the beautiful promenade of Ölüdeniz.
