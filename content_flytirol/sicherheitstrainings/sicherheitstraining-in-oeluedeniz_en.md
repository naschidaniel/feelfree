# Safety Training Ölüdeniz - Turkey

Already a paraglider pilot with an A-license and looking to optimally prepare for exceptional flight situations while combining it with a vacation? Fly with **Fly Tyrol flight school** to the beautiful Lycian Coast of Turkey for professional guidance from **Sebastian Kahn** in simulating extreme situations and perfecting various descent techniques such as the spiral dive and B-stall to master or avoid critical flight situations in the future.

You'll spend your **safety training with like-minded individuals** near the coastal town of Fethiye in the Turkish region of **Ölüdeniz**, known for its clear turquoise waters and vibrant shades of blue and green in the lagoon.

To enjoy this aerial view, we launch our flights from **Mount Babadağ**. After a breathtaking flight over the Lycian Coast, we land on the fine sandy beach of the bay, inviting you for a refreshing swim.

On the day after arrival, the safety training **starts with an area briefing**, maneuver discussions using the flight simulator, and reference materials. Individual participant preferences, skills, and concerns are addressed during this session. The specific learning goals of each participant are also taken into account.

To best support participants in the safety training exercises, pilots are guided **via radio by our instructor**. This allows maneuvers to be repeated and corrected during flights. The flights are also recorded with a camera, and the video material is analyzed and discussed with participants in the evening. Additionally, a rescue boat is available at all times for course participants.

After flights, theory sessions, and discussions for the next day, the group gathers for a communal dinner on the beautiful promenade of Ölüdeniz.
