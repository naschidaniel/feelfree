# Thermal Flying Course

Similar to birds, paragliders can use thermals to significantly extend the flying experience. With our thermal flight offering, you will be accompanied by one of our well-trained instructors who will provide important information and tips via radio during the flight.

Our extensive flying area in the Kitzb√ºhel Alps invites you to enjoy the beautiful panorama overlooking the main Alpine ridge and the Wilder Kaiser.

Both theoretically and practically, our instructor will safely introduce you to thermal flying, allowing you to easily find and make effective use of thermal spots in the future.

If you do not yet have your own equipment, you can inquire at Fly Tirol Flight School and rent an appropriate parachute with harness in advance.
